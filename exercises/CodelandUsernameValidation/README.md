This is a novel solution to the CoderByte ["Codeland Username Validation"](https://coderbyte.com/information/Codeland%20Username%20Validation) problem.

Unfortunately, Codeland doesn't suppose the use of Data Annotations, so this solution cannot be submitted to 
their automated assessment system, leaving this as a simple novelty and example of leveraging Data Annotations.

AI did not write this code or any of the comments - if it looks like it was AI generated, it's probably because the AI
is copying me rather than the other way around!
